          <h2>Introduction To Programming Language.</h2>

          <p>
            A program is a list of instructions in a logical sequence which are
            needed to be performed in order to accomplish a given task or solve
            a given problem on a computer. The process by which a user specifies
            to the computer in a particular programming language what s/he wants
            the computer to do is referred to as programming. Since the computer
            cannot think on its own, it is the programmer that will give the
            detailed steps, as well as the sequence in which steps are to be
            taken, in solving the problem.

          <h3>Evolution of Programming Languages</h3>
          <p>
            Hundreds of programming languages have been developed in the last
            fifty years. Many of them remained in the labs and the ones, which
            have good and more general features, got recognized. Every language
            that is introduced comes with features upon which its success is
            judged. In the initial years, languages were developed for specific
            purposes, which limited their scope. However, as the computer
            revolution spread affecting common man, the language needed to be
            molded to suit all kinds of applications. Every new language
            inherited certain features from existing languages and added its own
            features. The chronology of developments in programming languages is
            given below:-

            <h3>Features of Good Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>
              The features of one programming language may differ from the
              other. One can be easier and simple while another can be difficult
              and complex. The program written for a specific task may have few
              lines in one language while many lines in another. The success and
              strength of a programming language is judge with respect to
              standard features. To begin the language selection process, it is
              important to establish some criteria that makes a language good. A
              good language choice should provide a path into the future in a
              number of important ways.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature__list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Ease of use:</span> This is the most
                important factor in choosing a language. The language should be
                easy in writing codes for the programs and executing them. The
                ease and clarity of a language depends upon its syntax. It
                should be capable enough to provide clear, simple, and unified
                set of concepts. The vocabulary of the language should resemble
                English (or some other natural language). Any concept that
                cannot easily be explained to amateurs should not be included in
                the language. Part-time programmers do not want to struggle with
                difficult concepts; they just want to get a job done quickly and
                easily.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Portability:</span> The language should
                support the construction of code in a way that it could be
                distributed across multiple platforms (operating systems).
                Computer languages should be independent of any particular
                hardware or operating systems, that is, programs written on one
                platform should be able to be tested or transferred to any other
                computer or platform and there it should perform accurately.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Reliability:</span> The language should
                support construction of components that can be expected to
                perform their intended functions in a satisfactory manner
                throughout its lifetime. Reliability is concerned with making a
                system failure free, and thus is concerned with all possible
                errors. The language should have the support of error detection
                as well as prevention. It should make some kinds of errors
                impossible for example, some errors can be prevented by a strict
                syntax checking. Apart from prevention, the language should also
                be able to detect and report errors in the program. For example
                errors such as arithmetic overflow and assertions should be
                detected properly and reported to the programmers immediately so
                that the error can be rectified. The language should provide
                reliability by supporting explicit mechanism for dealing with
                problems that are detected when the system is in operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Safety:</span> Safety is concerned with the
                extent to which the language supports the construction of safety
                critical systems, yielding systems that are fault tolerant,
                fail-safe or robust in the face of systemic failures. The system
                must always do what is expected and be able to recover from any
                situation that might lead to a mishap or actual system hazard.
                Thus, safety tries to ensure that any failures that occurs
                result in minor consequences, and even potentially dangerous
                failures are handled in a fail-safe fashion. Language can
                facilitate this through such features as built-in consistency
                checking and exceptional handling.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Performance:</span> In some applications,
                performance is a big issue. By performance, we mean that the
                language should not only be capable of interacting with the end
                users, but also with the hardware. The language should also
                support software engineering mechanism, discouraging or
                prohibiting poor practices and supporting maintenance
                activities. This is the main reason why C language is used for
                developing operating systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Cost:</span> Cost component is a primary
                concern before deploying a language at a commercial level. It
                includes several costs such as; program execution and
                translation cost, program creation, testing and use, program
                maintenance
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Compact Code:</span> A good language should
                also promote compact coding, that is, the intended operations
                should be coded in a minimum number of lines. Even if the
                language is powerful, and is not able to perform the task in
                small amount of codes, then it is bound to be unpopular. This is
                the main reason of C language’s popularity over other languages
                in developing complex applications. Larger codes require more
                testing and developing time, thereby increasing the cost of
                developing an application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Maintainability:</span> Creating an
                application is not the end of the system development. It should
                be maintained regularly so that it can be modified to satisfy
                new requirement or to correct deficiencies. Maintainability is
                actually facilitated by most of the languages, which makes it
                easier to understand and then change the software.
                Maintainability is closely linked with the structure of the
                code. If the original code were written in an organized way
                (Structural Programming) then it would be easy to modify or add
                new changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Provides Interface To Other Language:</span>
                From the perspective of the language, interface to other
                language refers to the extent to which the selected language
                supports interfacing feature to other languages. This type of
                support can have a significant impact on the reliability of the
                data, which is exchanged between applications, developed with
                different languages. In case of data exchange between units of
                different languages, without specific language support, no
                checking may be done on the data or even on their existence.
                Hence, the potential for unreliability becomes high-modern day
                languages have come a long way and most of the languages provide
                interface support for other languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Concurrency Support:</span> Concurrency
                support refers to the extent to which inherent language supports
                the construction of code with multiple threads of control (also
                known as parallel processing). For some applications, multiple
                threads of control are very useful or even necessary. This is
                particularly true for real time systems and those running on
                architecture with multiple processors. It can also provide the
                programmer with more control over its implementation. Other
                features include Reusability and Standardization.

          <h2>Classification and Generations of Programming Languages</h2>
          <p>
            The computer language is machine language that is 0’s and 1’s.
            Communication with the computer is via machine language. This
            language is cumbersome and not easy to remember, which lead to the
            development of assembly language and high-level language that are
            more English like in nature. The classification and generation of
            computers is based on machine language, assembly language and
            High-level language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computers understand only one language and that is binary language
            (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also known as machine language. In the
            initial years of computer programming, all the instructions were
            given in binary form only. Although these programs were easily
            understood by the computer, it proved too difficult for a human
            being to remember all the instructions in the form of 0’s and 1’s.
            Therefore, the computer remained a mystery to a common man until
            other languages such as assembly and high –level languages were
            developed which were easier to learn and understood. These languages
            use commands that have some degree of similarity with English (such
            as if else, exit)
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming languages can be grouped into three major categories:
            machine language, assembly (low-level) language and high–level
            languages.

              represent data and the instructions written in this language,
              consists of series of 0’s and 1’s. Machine language is the only
              language understood by the computer. The machine language is
              peculiar to each type of computer.

              1’s to run a machine. It is called low-level because of its
              closeness to the machine language.
