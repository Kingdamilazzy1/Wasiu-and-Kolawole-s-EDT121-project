            <p>
              Since early 1950s, programming languages have evolved
              tremendously. This evolution has resulted in the development of
              hundreds of different languages. With each passing year, the
              languages become user-friendly and more powerful than their
              predecessors. We can illustrate the development of all the
              language in five generations.

            <h3>FIRST GENERATION:- MACHINE LANGUAGE</h3>
            <p>
              The first language was binary, also known as machine language,
              which was used in the earliest computers and machines. We know
              that computers are digital devices, which have only two states, ON
              and OFF (1 and 0). Hence, computers can understand only two binary
              codes, 1 and 0. Therefore, every instruction and data should be
              written using 0’s and 1’s. Machine language is also known as the
              computer’s ‘native’ language because this system of codes is
              directly understood by the computer.

                costly as well as difficult for the organization. E.g. program

                specify each operation, and the specific location for each piece
                of data and instruction to be stored. It means that a programmer
                partially needs to be a hardware expert to have proper control

                effort to keep track of the logic of the problems and,
                therefore, result in frequent programming errors.

                to re-program the entire logic again. Therefore, it is very
                tedious and time consuming, and since time is a precious

                costly.

            <h3>SECOND GENERATION: Assembly (low-level) languages.</h3>
            <p>
              The complexities of machines languages led to the search of
              another language and the assembly language was developed. It was
              developed in the early 1950s and the main developer was IBM.
              Assembly language allows the programmers to interact directly with
              the hardware. This language assigns mnemonic codes to each machine
              language instruction to make it easier to remember or write. It
              allows better human- readable method of writing program as
              compared to writing in binary bit patterns.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="epl gpl">
            <p>
              Unlike other programming languages, assembly language is not a
              single language but a group of languages. Each processor family
              (and sometimes individual processors within a processor family)
              has its own assembly languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              An assembly language provides mnemonic instructions, usually three
              letters long, corresponding to each machine instruction. The
              letters are usually abbreviated indicating what the instruction
              does: For example, ADD is used to perform an addition operation,
              MUL for multiplication, and so on. Assembly languages make it
              easier for humans to remember how to write instruction to the
              computer, but an assembly language is still a representation of
              the computer’s native instruction set. Since each type of computer
              uses a different native instruction set, assembly languages cannot
              be standardized from one machine to another, and instructions from
              one computer cannot be expected to work on another.

          <div class="epl gpl">
            <h4>Assembler:</h4>
            <p>
              Assembly language is nothing more than a symbolic representation
              of machine code, which also allows symbolic designation of memory
              location. However, no matter how close assembly language is to
              machines codes, the computer still cannot understand it. The
              assembly language programs must be translated into machine codes
              by a separate program called Assemblers. The assembler program
              recognizes the character strings that make up the symbolic names
              of the various machine operations, and substitute the required
              machine code for each instruction. At the same time, it also
              calculates the required address in memory for each symbolic name
              of a memory location, and substitutes those addresses for the
              names resulting in a machine language program that can run on its
              own at any time. An assembler converts the assembly codes into
              binary codes and then it assembles the machine understandable code
              into the main memory of the computer, making it ready for
              execution.

              The original assembly language program is also known as the source
              code, while the final machine language program is designated the
              object code. If an assembly language program needs to be changed
              or corrected, it is necessary to make the changes to the source
              code and then re-assemble it to create a new object program. The
              functions of an assembler are given below:
